It also tries to better reflect the mental model of a\\nsoftware developer, rather than strictly following an arbitrary mathematical model.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### Problem\\n\\nThe best way to illustrate this problem is by starting with showing code fragments of varying complexity and why it\u2019s necessary to have\\nmeasurement tools in the first place.\\n\\n<span class=\'text--center\'>\\n  [![A linked list](https://mstone.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/img-increased-cognitive-complexity.jpg \'Code problems counted & \\nvisualized\')](https://blog.devgenius.io/sonarqube-cognitive-complexity-265640dbad3e)\\n</span>\\n\\nHere\u2019s a straightforward, simple example of a summarizer written in Python.\\n\\n```python title=\'Sum all numbers in an array.\'\\ndef sum_of_numbers(numbers):\\n    total = 0\\n\\n    for num in numbers:\\n        total += num\\n\\n    return total\\n```\\n\\nIt consists of a single loop, has no nested conditions, and is easy to read & understand, resulting in a very low cognitive load.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the code below is overly complicated and awkward, making it difficult to understand at a glance, increasing cognitive load\\nsubstantially.\\n\\n```python title=\'Authenticate & Authorize the user.\'\\ndef authenticate_and_authorize(user, password, roles):\\n    if not user or not password:\\n        return \'Missing credentials\'\\n\\n    if len(password) < 8:\\n        return \'Password too short\'\\n\\n    if not any(char.isdigit() for char in password):\\n        return \'Password must contain a digit\'\\n\\n    if not any(char.isupper() for char in password):\\n        return \'Password must contain a capital letter\'\\n\\n    if not user.get(\'active\', False):\\n        return \'Inactive account\'\\n\\n    if user.get(\'locked\', False):\\n        return \'Account locked\'\\n\\n    if user.get(\'password\') != password:\\n        return \'Invalid password\'\\n\\n    if roles and user.get(\'role\') not in roles:\\n        return \'Role not allowed\'\\n\\n    return \'Access granted\'\\n```\\n\\nThis function is obviously a mess; it\u2019s very clear that something must be done about it to simplify and make it more pleasant to the eye.\\n\\nSomething like this is far better and clearly highlights the issue.\\n\\n```python title=\'Authenticate & Authorize the user (clean version).\'\\ndef authenticate_and_authorize(user, password, roles=None):\\n    if not user or not password:\\n        return \'Missing credentials\'\\n\\n    error = run_checks(\\n        lambda: validate_password(password),\\n        lambda: check_account(user),\\n        lambda: verify_password(user, password),\\n        lambda: check_role(user, roles),\\n    )\\n\\n    return error or \'Access granted\'\\n```\\n\\nWhile the overall file increased in size due to code splitting, the main function is now very easy to wrap your head around.\\n\\n### Methodology\\n\\nCognitive Complexity is measured by the following three rules:\\n\\n1. **Ignore structures that allow multiple statements to be readably shorthanded\\n   into one.**\\n2. **Increment (add one) for each break in the linear flow of the code.**\\n3. **Increment when flow-breaking structures are nested.**\\n\\nComplexity score uses four different types of increments:\\n\\n- **Nesting** - assessed for nesting control flow structures inside each other.\\n- **Structural** - assessed on control flow structures that are subject to a nesting\\n  increment, and that increase the nesting count.\\n- **Fundamental** - assessed on statements not subject to a nesting increment.\\n- **Hybrid** - assessed on control flow structures that are not subject to a nesting\\n  increment, but which do increase the nesting count.\\n\\nThis distinction makes it useful to understand where the score is coming from and what exactly the problem is with the code block.\\n\\nHere are concrete examples considered to make the score better reflect what software developers think of code.\\n\\n- **Shorthands are ignored.**\\n- **Loops and recursions increment.**\\n- **Conditionals, catches, and switches increment.**\\n\\nWith all of this taken into account, these would be the general suggestions to lower the score, thus writing cleaner code.\\n\\n<span class=\'text--center\'>\\n  [![A colored chart](https://mstone.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/img-reduce-cognitive-complexity.jpg \'Chart of emerging suggestions\')](https://mstone.ai/glossary/cognitive-complexity)\\n</span>\\n\\n- **Break down large functions into smaller methods.**\\n- **Flatten nested structures with early returns.**\\n- **Adopt clear, consistent naming conventions.**\\n- **Leverage analysis tools such as linters & formatters.**\\n- **Teamwork helps unwrap & explain problematic code.**\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nBy using the explained methodology, applying the aforementioned suggestions, and following the emerging guidelines, software engineers\\nwill be able to write better, cleaner code with efficiency and ease, being able to better understand which parts of code need\\nrefactoring and the exact reasons why.\\n\\nHappy Coding!"},{"id":"/2024/07/19/big-o","metadata":{"permalink":"/eldarlrd/blog/2024/07/19/big-o","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-19-big-o.md","title":"\ud83d\udcc8 Big O","description":"On a mathematical tool used to calculate time complexity in software algorithms.","date":"2024-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"computer-science","permalink":"/eldarlrd/blog/tags/computer-science"},{"inline":true,"label":"math","permalink":"/eldarlrd/blog/tags/math"}],"readingTime":2.99,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Eldar Pashazade","title":"Frontend Developer","url":"https://eldarlrd.is-a.dev","image_url":"https://github.com/eldarlrd.png","email":"eldarlrd@pm.me","imageURL":"https://github.com/eldarlrd.png","socials":{},"key":null,"page":null}],"frontMatter":{"authors":{"name":"Eldar Pashazade","title":"Frontend Developer","url":"https://eldarlrd.is-a.dev","image_url":"https://github.com/eldarlrd.png","email":"eldarlrd@pm.me","imageURL":"https://github.com/eldarlrd.png"},"tags":["computer-science","math"],"keywords":["computer-science","math"],"image":"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:825/1*iQkFjNn02oogc2Yv27-pyQ.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"\ud83e\udde0 Cognitive Complexity","permalink":"/eldarlrd/blog/2025/11/25/cognitive-complexity"},"nextItem":{"title":"\ud83d\udd11 Licenses","permalink":"/eldarlrd/blog/2023/08/23/licenses"}},"content":"**On a mathematical tool used to calculate time complexity in software algorithms.**\\n\\nAlso known as _Landau\'s notation,_ it allows for measuring the speed of a given function based on the specifics of its implementation, where\\nO is the rate of growth of the function, standing for its order of approximation.

This was done primarily to counter the companies of the time that would steal a foreign artist\'s work,\\nmodify it, and then resell it under their own brand for profit. Prior to this convention, combating such behavior would require the artist\\nto explicitly state copyright and then go on to personally defend it in court.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### Copyright\\n\\nAfter the [Berne Convention,](https://wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne) copyright was automatically asserted as soon as the work was created.\\nAs in, as soon as artistic work is made, it is already copyrighted by the creator, and thus it\'ll be protected. This work includes anything\\nlike text, images, architecture, hardware, etc. The convention has now been ratified in nearly all countries in the world.\\n\\nBut then, why do we keep seeing \xa9, (c), and \\"Copyright\\" notices everywhere? There are two reasons.\\n\\nFirst, the U.S. did not ratify the convention [until 1989,](https://copyright.gov/title17/92appk.pdf) but instead they opted to make\\nexplicit copyright assertions easier by creating the \xa9 sign and requiring its presence on any work of art alongside the name of the artist\\nand the date of production. Because of this, until ratification, artists were required to put \xa9 on the work for it to be considered\\ncopyrighted.\\n\\nSecond, the reason why artists and companies insist on using the \xa9, (c), and/or \\"Copyright\\" is because explicit statements make it easier to\\ndefend the copyright in court.\\n\\nWhy (c)? Because typical typewriters don\'t have the \xa9 sign, it\'d get approximated to (c).\\n\\nAll copyrights, trademarks, and patents are recognized by all the members of the convention. The word \\"Copyright\\" must always be written in\\nEnglish.\\n\\n### Trademark\\n\\nTrademarks, often indicated with \u2122, are a way of registering a brand name, logo, slogan, etc. so that the product can have an official\\nsignature of being genuine. Coca-Cola is a trademarked brand name; one can\'t release their own product under that name to lure potential\\ncustomers into buying their product instead. Trademarks have to be renewed with the body that issued them.\\n\\nRegistered trademarks carry the \xae symbol, which signifies that the trademark has\\nbeen [officially registered](https://uspto.gov/sites/default/files/trademarks/law/Trademark_Statutes.pdf) by the appropriate state office.\\nIt, too, is sometimes approximated to (r).\\n\\n### Patents\\n\\nPatents are a way of registering an invention by publishing the schematics for it publicly and, in return, getting a 20 year\\ngrant [enforced by the state](https://uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/consolidated_laws.pdf) to be the sole producer of the given invention.\\nIt\'s meant to reward and incentivize inventions by giving the innovator a headstart so that they can capitalize on their idea and make a\\nprofit. However, after 20 years, the patent expires and cannot be renewed. Meaning every other interested body can now produce the same\\ninvention themselves using the public schematics.\\n\\n### Software Licenses\\n\\nIf one desires to share the right to modify, publish, or resell work, they have to provide a license. They\'re a lease given by the copyright\\nholder that allows some other body to interact with the work in the capacity that is provided in the license. It\'s recommended that one use\\nofficially registered licenses and not create their own, since said licenses have already likely been defended in court.\\n\\nThere are many different types of licenses for various categories of work, Software is considered to be _text material_ and has its own\\ncommonly used set of [open source licenses.](https://opensource.org/licenses)\\n\\n<span class=\'text--center\'>\\n  [![A colored pie chart](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*veAZORAsRKvXWCjlHA_nuA.png \'2015 GitHub statistics for license use\')](https://github.blog/2015-03-09-open-source-license-usage-on-github-com)\\n</span>\\n\\nThe most popular license now is the permissive [MIT License,](https://mit-license.org) which allows anyone to copy, modify, and republish\\nwork as well as use it as a part of proprietary software for profit.
